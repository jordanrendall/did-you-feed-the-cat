It is a constant question, at least for us, since our cat has the ability to fool us to think he has not eaten in days.

This app will develop over time.

Currently, the app offers the following features:

- user signup/login
- add/remove pets per user
- log feeding for a given pet
- display last feeding for each pet
- send a request to connect with another user (via their email)

> Note: you will need to rename the `sample.env` file to `.env` and set an appropriate mongodb connection string as well as a production endpoint if applicable.

To get started:

```
git clone https://github.com/jordanrendall/did-you-feed-the-cat.git
cd did-you-feed-the-cat
npm run dev
```
